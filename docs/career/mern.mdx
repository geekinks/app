## What is Full-Stack Development?
Full-stack developers are the versatile architects of the web, proficient in both frontend (user interface) and backend (server-side) development. They possess the skills to build complete web applications, from the visual elements users interact with to the underlying databases and server logic.

## What Do Full-Stack Developers Do?

- **Work Across the Entire Development Process:** Collaborate with designers, product managers, and other developers to bring ideas to life.
- **Solve Complex Problems:** Utilize their knowledge across different technologies to create innovative solutions.
- **Stay Ahead of the Curve:** Continuously learn and adapt to the ever-evolving world of web development.

## Why MERN?
The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies that empowers you to build robust, scalable, and modern web applications.
- **MongoDB:** A flexible and scalable NoSQL database for managing your application's data.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js, simplifying API development and server-side routing.
